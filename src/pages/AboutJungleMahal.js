  <h2>About Jungle Mahal</h2>
  <p>
    Jungle Mahal is a beautiful and culturally rich region located in the western part of West Bengal, covering areas of 
    <strong>Purulia</strong>, <strong>Bankura</strong>, and <strong>Jhargram</strong> districts. The region is known for its dense forests, rolling hills, scenic landscapes, 
    and vibrant tribal communities.

    The area offers immense potential for <em>eco-tourism</em>, <em>adventure tourism</em>, and <em>cultural tourism</em>. Visitors can explore unspoiled nature, experience traditional tribal festivals,
